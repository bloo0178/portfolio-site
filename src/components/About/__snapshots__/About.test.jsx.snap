      About
    </h1>
    <p>
      I am fascinated with the infinite challenge of learning and applying technology to evolve the things we do. My passion is software development, grounded in over a decade of professional experience applying systems and design thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have worked between businesses and users throughout my career - defining how to use technology to support those relationships. Most recently as a Solutions Architect at an award-winning digital business consultancy, I collaborated with UX designers and developers to create digital strategies paired with custom software solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I currently work heavily with React for interface development and have been using serverless approaches for backend needs. I am not rigid in my technology choices and refresh my knowledge regularly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am interested in opportunities that involve solving practical business or systemic problems through focused analysis, system design, and ultimately directed software development. If my background interests you, let's connect and see how we can work together.
