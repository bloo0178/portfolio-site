# Description

Repository for the front-end code of my portfolio site (hosted on jeffbloom.io). This pairs with my portfolio-api codebase, which is where I house my project data. The project data source is a DynamoDB table on AWS that is served up via AWS serverless stack. As new entries are added, they populate the project cards on the portfolio page.
